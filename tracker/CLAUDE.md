# tracker/ — Cloud DB + Autonomous Simulator + Legacy Local Code

This subsystem manages all trade state for the autonomous AI hedge fund. As of 2026-04-30 the architecture is **fully cloud** — no Mac dependency. Moomoo + OpenD are retired.

## Cloud architecture (current)

```

No part of this requires the user's Mac to be on. Everything runs in GitHub Actions and Turso.

## Turso (cloud DB)

Free tier database used as the live trade ledger. Schema mirrors local `db.py`'s `Trade` and `DailySummary` plus two new tables:

- `trades` — same columns as local schema + `last_checked_at TEXT` + `position_size_class TEXT NULL` (added 2026-05-05 for System B's small_scaled position class — see root CLAUDE.md)
- `daily_summary` — unchanged
- `fills` — `(trade_id, event_type, price, bar_timestamp, reason, created_at)` audit log of every state change
- `pending_decisions` — reserved for future use

Credentials live in `.env` (local) and GitHub Actions secrets (`TURSO_DATABASE_URL`, `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`).

**Public API of `turso_client.py`:**
```python
create_all_tables()
get_all_trades() -> list[dict]
get_open_positions() -> list[dict]   # status='entered'
get_pending_trades() -> list[dict]   # status='pending'
insert_trade(d: dict) -> int
update_trade(trade_id: int, **kwargs)
log_fill(trade_id, event_type, price, bar_timestamp, reason) -> int
```

## Simulator (replaces Moomoo)

`tracker/simulator.py` — runs on GitHub Actions cron every 5 min. Logic:

1. Pull pending + entered positions from Turso
2. Download 1-min yfinance bars for all involved tickers (single batched call)
3. For each position, walk bars **after `max(last_checked_at, decision_made_at + 60s)`** (during 9:30-16:00 ET only). The `decision_made_at` floor (added 2026-05-07) prevents the simulator from filling orders against bars that occurred before the trade was created.
4. **Expiry pass (added 2026-05-07):** before walking bars, if status is `pending` and `now > entry_valid_until` (or the safety-cap fallback at 16:00 ET on the decision day), mark the trade `status='expired'`, set `pnl=NULL`, `exit_fill_price=NULL`, write an audit row to `fills` with `event_type='expired'`. Skip the bar loop for that trade.
5. For pending trades: if bar.low ≤ entry (long) or bar.high ≥ entry (short) → fill at entry, mark `entered`
6. For entered trades: check stop and target intra-bar; fill at the trigger price (not the bar extreme)
7. Trailing stop on `target_price_2`: when first target hits, move stop to `entry_price` and replace target with `target_price_2`
8. Update `last_checked_at` on every cycle whether or not a fill happened (idempotent — no double-process)
9. Write every fill event to `fills` table

`--dry-run` flag prints what would happen without writing.

### Two `trades`-table columns added 2026-05-07 for time discipline

| Column | Source | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `decision_made_at` | `decisions.json.generated_at` (set by `decisions_writer.py`); ingester copies into Turso | Simulator's `_floor_for_fresh_trade()` — never process bars from before this time |
| `entry_valid_until` | Per-trade ISO timestamp set by judge agent (Gate 7 in `b_judge.md`); null = use safety cap (end of decision-day at 16:00 ET) | Simulator's expiry pass — if past expiry without fill, mark `status='expired'` |

History note: prior to 2026-05-07, the simulator's fallback for fresh trades was `start_of_today` (NY midnight). This caused three real paper trades (ROK id=7, CMI id=8, TLN id=9) to be filled retroactively against 9:30-AM-ET market-open bars even though the orders were created at 10:10+ AM ET. Bug confirmed against yfinance 1-minute data; corrected via `scripts/fix_pre_simulator_bug_trades.py`. See root `CLAUDE.md` for the dated incident write-up.

## Decision Ingester (closes the loop)

`tracker/ingest_decisions.py` — runs immediately before the simulator in the workflow:

1. Read `tracker/ingested_runs.txt` to know which run IDs have already been processed
2. For each `runs/<run_id>/` folder NOT already seen and that has `decisions.json`:
   - Skip if action is `hold` or `neutral`
   - Skip if entry_price is null/0 or quantity ≤ 0
   - Insert pending trade into Turso (double-safety check: skip if `(run_id, ticker)` already exists)
   - Append `run_id` to `ingested_runs.txt`
3. Print `Ingested N new trades from M new runs (K runs already seen)`

Idempotent. Safe to re-run any time. The 41 historical run folders existing on 2026-04-30 are pre-marked as ingested so only future routine runs flow into the simulator.

`_ensure_schema()` helper added 2026-05-05: idempotent `ALTER TABLE trades ADD COLUMN position_size_class TEXT NULL` wrapped in try/except that swallows "duplicate column" errors. Called once on import. Acceptable tech debt for paper trading; if column changes accelerate, adopt a real migration tool.

## Dashboard

`dashboard/build.py` reads Turso + `runs/` + `wiki/` + yfinance, renders 4 page types via Jinja2:
- Live positions (open trades with current P&L)
- Today's decisions (feed of routine outputs)
- Closed trades history (with win rate + total P&L)
- Per-ticker drill-down (one HTML per ticker in watchlist)

Output: `dashboard/dist/`. Pushed to gh-pages branch every 5 min by the workflow.

## Watchlist + budget

`watchlist.json` config keys:
- `tickers` — universe analyzed
- `schedules` — routine schedule definitions
- `paper_account_size` — virtual cash for budget enforcement
- `wiki_enabled: true` — wiki memory layer (currently ON)

Budget logic still lives in legacy `db.py` for the **ai_hedge.runner.aggregate** pipeline (PM sees portfolio state from local SQLite). The simulator/ingester do NOT enforce budget — that's the PM's job upstream.

## Legacy code (still present, no longer the primary path)

- `db.py` — SQLAlchemy local SQLite. Still used by `ai_hedge.runner.aggregate.py` and CLI tools. Keep as-is.
- `moomoo_client.py`, `executor.py`, `monitor.py` — Moomoo paper trading. The autonomous flow does NOT call these. Kept for backward compat with the old `python -m tracker execute` CLI.
- `python -m tracker` CLI commands (`execute`, `monitor`, `report`, `status`, `cash`) still work locally if someone wants the old Moomoo flow. Not used in production.

## Conventions

- **Production trade state lives in Turso, not `tracker.db`.** Local SQLite is now a backup and a backward-compat layer.
- The simulator gracefully handles "no yfinance data" (weekends, halts, delisted tickers) — logs a warning and skips.
- Don't manually `INSERT INTO trades` — use `tracker.turso_client.insert_trade()`. It validates columns.
- Don't add a `tracker execute` step to the swing skill — paper-order placement is the simulator's job (autonomous, not human-triggered).
