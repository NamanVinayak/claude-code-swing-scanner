# AAPL — Trades

**Rationale.** Head trader neutral (42 conf) after Q2 FY2026 earnings beat (EPS $2.01, gross margin 49.3% record). Breakout above $276.11 on 2.08x volume confirmed on April 30. System will not chase at $282 — hourly Z-score 2.52 and Bollinger %B 1.28 flag overextension. Entry trigger: pullback to $274–278 (Fib 38.2% / daily upper Bollinger Band confluence) with ADX rising above 19. Size: 2 shares × $276 = $552, within risk manager cap $768. Key risks: insider net selling (-$235M), ADX still sub-25, prior portfolio loss on similar NVDA setup (-$63.20 corrected; was originally -$264.65 due to a sizing bug, fixed in commit b2b472d).

**What happened.** The Apr 17 swing run was the first run to give AAPL a buy signal after two consecutive no-trade decisions. Intended entry $262.50 was a limit order that sat unfilled for 11 days and was abandoned April 29. No capital at risk was incurred.

## Notes and lessons

**Q2 earnings binary resolved bullishly.** The April 30 run (20260430_144524) was blocked by the 3-day earnings blackout. May 1 run (20260501_144523) is the first post-earnings entry attempt. Gross margin at 49.3% (record) falsified the bear-case margin-collapse scenario the model was hedging against.

**Entry discipline maintained.** The system is not chasing the gap from $271 to $282. Limit at $276 reflects the confluence of Fib 38.2% and daily upper Bollinger Band — the same pullback discipline that (with hindsight) would have avoided the NVDA dip-buy stop-out (-$63.20 corrected; was originally -$264.65 from a sizing bug — see `wiki/meta/lessons.md`).

**Watch for re-queue.** The Apr 17 abandoned trade suggests the daily order expiry may not auto-re-queue. If the $276 limit order expires without a fill, manual resubmission or a new run will be needed. (Source: trades.md, prior runs.)
