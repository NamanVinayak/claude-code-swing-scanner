# NVDA — Thesis

## TL;DR

⚠️ Recent trade: stop_hit 2026-04-30, -$63.20 corrected (originally -$264.65 due to sizing bug, see commit b2b472d). Thesis under review.

NVDA dominates the AI chip market (~81% share) in a multi-year capex supercycle. Fundamentals remain exceptional — 61% revenue growth, 144% earnings growth, 59% operating margin, near-zero leverage, D/E 0.11. The structural thesis is intact. **What changed:** the prior bear case cited RSI 81–87 and z-score 2.39–2.42 as overextension risks; those risks have now resolved (RSI-14 59.74, z-score 1.06 as of 2026-05-01 run). The new dominant risk is that the $208.20 invalidation level has been broken on 1.52x volume — price is now at $199.57, testing the 38.2% Fib / EMA-21 confluence zone ($196.75–$197.67). One entry on 2026-04-30 (originally sized 67 shares due to a now-fixed budget bug; corrected sizing was 16 shares) was stopped out at $205.30, recording -$63.20 in realized loss (corrected from the original -$264.65 buggy figure; see `wiki/meta/lessons.md` for full context). Entry discipline remains paramount: do not chase.

**Prior thesis claim falsified:** the 2026-04-29 thesis stated "every run that scored a buy was entered below the EMA-10 on a pullback." The Apr 30 entry at $209.25 was near the EMA-10 ($203.99 today) but above the Fib 38.2% — and was stopped out as price continued lower. The real entry zone is the EMA-21 / Fib 38.2% confluence at $196.75–$197.67.

## Bull case

- **AI capex supercycle is intact.** Alphabet Q1 +7% and Amazon Q1 +2% post-earnings confirmed GPU spend expansion. Analyst consensus: 94% Buy, avg PT $270, implies ~35% upside from $199.57. (web_research/NVDA.json, run 20260501_124529)
- **Technology lead is durable.** Blackwell Ultra leads AMD/Intel by "two generations" per benchmarks. Rubin architecture (TSMC 3nm, HBM4) on roadmap for late 2026, targeting 10x inference cost reduction. (web_research/NVDA.json, 20260501_124529)
- **Fundamentals are exceptional.** ROE 121%, net margin 52.7%, operating margin 59%, current ratio 4.44, D/E 0.11. PEG ratio 0.76 — cheap relative to growth rate despite high headline P/E. Owner-earnings model shows intrinsic value ~$29T vs $4.85T market cap. (fundamentals_analyst_agent, valuation_analyst_agent, run 20260501_124529)
- **Trend structure is one of the strongest on record.** Daily ADX 55.96, all EMAs aligned bullish (EMA-10 $203.99 > EMA-21 $197.67 > EMA-50 $190.52 > EMA-200 $177.38), RSI-14 59.74 (healthy, not stretched). This is a pullback within an intact uptrend. (swing_trend_momentum, 20260501_124529)
- **Earnings catalyst.** NVDA Q1 FY2027 earnings ~May 20, 2026 — management guided ~77% revenue growth YoY, analyst consensus at ~79%. Hard exit deadline ~May 17 (3-day pre-earnings blackout). (web_research/NVDA.json, 20260501_124529)

## Bear case

- **$208.20 invalidation level breached.** The prior wiki hard-stop at $208.20 was broken on 1.52x average volume — technically a breakdown, not a pullback. Swing_breakout agent (20260501_124529) flags this as a regime change, not a healthy dip. Price must reclaim $208.20 to restore the prior structure.
- **Same setup failed once and we have ZERO wins on it.** The "EMA pullback Fib dip-buy" setup is 0 wins / 1 stop / -$63.20 (corrected, single trade) in the last 30 days. Averaging down into a pattern with a 0% recent win rate is a capital preservation concern — wait for confirmed reversal before re-entering. (swing_head_trader, 20260501_124529; trade ledger Turso id 112)
- **Meta capex contagion risk.** Meta fell 9% on AI capex shock ($125–145B raised guidance). If Amazon or MSFT cut AI capex, NVDA demand thesis is directly impacted. (swing_macro_context, 20260501_124529)
- **China headwind permanent.** US H20 export restrictions caused a $4.5B charge. Zero China H200 revenue. Custom ASIC threat (Google TPUs, AWS Trainium) is a longer-term structural risk. (web_research/NVDA.json, 20260501_124529)
- **DCF gap remains.** DCF at standard WACC shows $585B intrinsic value vs $4.85T market cap — 87.9% gap. Price remains a bet on AI capex compounding. (valuation_analyst_agent, 20260501_124529)

## What would change my mind

**Bearish flip triggers:** second hyperscaler cuts AI capex; price closes below EMA-50 ($190.52) on volume; NVDA earnings miss attributable to demand slowdown (not export charges).

**Bullish conviction boost:** confirmed hourly reversal candle (hammer, bullish engulfing) at $196.75–$199.50 with hourly MACD histogram turning positive; AMD earnings confirm AI data center demand; price reclaims $208.20 on volume.
