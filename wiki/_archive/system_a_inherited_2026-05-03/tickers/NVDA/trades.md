# NVDA — Trades

## TL;DR

One formally closed NVDA position in Turso (trade id 112): originally booked as 67 shares @ $209.25 due to a phantom $100K budget bug (commit b2b472d), now corrected to its proper sizing of 16 shares (14.2% vol-adjusted limit on the actual $25K paper account). Stopped out at $205.30 on 2026-04-30, realized P&L **-$63.20** (corrected from the buggy -$264.65 that briefly appeared in earlier wiki versions). Four prior tracker.db entries (IDs 6, 12, 13, 21) were marked abandoned 2026-04-29 with no realized P&L. No open NVDA positions as of 2026-05-01. Latest 2026-05-01 run scored HOLD (R/R 2.67, conf 35) pending hourly reversal candle at $196.75–$199.50.

**Notes:** Originally booked at 67 shares ($14,020) because aggregate.py was running with a hardcoded `--cash 100000` budget instead of reading `paper_account_size` from `tracker/watchlist.json` (which was $5K at the time, now $25K). Bug fixed in commit `b2b472d`. With proper $25K budget × 14.167% vol-adjusted limit, position should have been **16 shares ($3,348)**. The trade was corrected on 2026-05-01 to reflect the strategy-appropriate size; original 67-share buggy values are preserved in the `fills` audit log. Stop at $205.30 = hourly Fib 61.8% level from the $216.83 high. 4/5 swing agents were bullish on entry (ADX 54.67, pullback to Fib 38.2% support), but price broke below the stop intraday.

## Lessons learned

1. **Apr 17 50-share order never filled.** Price had moved past $199.50 before the order was placed; the limit was too tight. Do not chase.
2. **Apr 15 entry was excellent.** Fills of $197.29 and $197.15 were below the $198.47 limit — favorable slippage. Position reached +8.1% unrealized by Apr 29.
3. **Abandonment vs formal close.** Four prior trades (IDs 6, 12, 13, 21) show None in the DB pnl column — the +$95.70 implied gain is not in realized P&L.
4. **Model waited correctly for pullback.** All prior runs flagged overextension. Apr 15 and Apr 30 are the only two runs where a clean entry existed near the constructive zone.
5. **EMA pullback dip-buy: 0 wins, 1 stop, -$63.20 (corrected) in 30 days.** This setup type requires a confirmed hourly reversal candle at the EMA-21 / Fib 38.2% confluence ($196.75–$197.67) before re-entry — not a blind dip-buy.
6. **$208.20 invalidation level must be respected.** The Apr 30 entry at $209.25 was just above $208.20. Price went on to break $208.20 decisively. The wiki's own hard stop was the right signal — trust it.
7. **Sizing bug taught us a meta-lesson.** A buggy $100K phantom budget produced a position 4× too large. The strategy itself wasn't broken — the engineering was. Going forward, the new conviction-based sizing model + hard caps should prevent this recurring.
