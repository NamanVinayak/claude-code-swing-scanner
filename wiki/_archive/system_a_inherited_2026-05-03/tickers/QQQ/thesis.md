# QQQ — Thesis

## TL;DR

QQQ is the Nasdaq-100 ETF — a concentrated bet on the top 100 non-financial Nasdaq companies (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon are the top six). It is the cleanest expression of large-cap tech momentum in the US market. Our two runs (daytrade on 2026-04-15 and swing on 2026-04-17) converge on the same structural view: the daily trend is unambiguously bullish but QQQ's extreme correlation with everything else we hold (0.96 vs SPY, 0.74 vs NVDA, 0.67 vs AMZN) means adding a full-size QQQ position on top of single-name tech longs is de facto leveraging the same bet twice.

## Bull case

- **Daily trend is intact.** As of April 17, 2026, ADX reads 36.08 on the daily with the squeeze momentum in bullish-breakout mode — both confirm a mature but still-running uptrend. [Source: signals_combined.json, dt_breakout_hunter QQQ, 20260415_104041]
- **Sector rotation into tech.** On April 15, QQQ outperformed SPY by an estimated 0.4–0.6% intraday as Nasdaq-100 megacaps (MSFT +2.1%, META +2.2%, AVGO +2.5%) carried the load while the Dow pared gains. [Source: web_research/QQQ.json, 20260415_104041]
- **AI capex supercycle.** Meta-Broadcom 1 GW custom AI chip deal, Microsoft Azure 39% growth trajectory, and Nvidia's 10-day winning streak (+18%) entering April 15 all signal that AI spending by the top QQQ components remains at cycle highs.
- **Options flow constructive.** WhaleStream showed net bullish QQQ flow on April 15; call-side open interest dominated at current strikes with a balanced 5-call/5-put unusual activity reading, net constructive. [Source: web_research/QQQ.json analyst_consensus]
- **Swing decision: buy at $640.47.** On April 17 the swing PM rated QQQ a Buy with 72% confidence, 8–12 trading day timeframe, target $668, stop $634, for a 4.25:1 risk-reward — the highest R:R in the 14-ticker cohort. [Source: decisions.json, 20260417_233350]

## Bear case

- **Valuation — ETF fundamentals not available.** The fundamentals agent and growth agent both returned bearish/zero signals for QQQ because standard financial ratios (P/E, ROE, net margin) are not applicable to an ETF wrapper. The bearish flag is a data artifact but the underlying warning is real: the Nasdaq-100 index trades at elevated forward P/E vs historical norms.
- **Extreme correlation kills diversification.** Correlation of 0.96 vs SPY and 0.74 vs NVDA means QQQ adds almost no independent alpha to a portfolio already long large-cap tech single names. The swing PM explicitly cut QQQ size to 12 shares to avoid double-counting. [Source: portfolio_notes, decisions.json, 20260417_233350]
- **Intraday structure was bearish on April 15.** The 5-minute SuperTrend had flipped bearish (value $633.70, overhead resistance), squeeze momentum was negative (-0.42), and all 9 DT agents voted neutral — the day-trade call was a firm no-trade sit-out. [Source: decisions.json, 20260415_104041]
- **Fed on hold with only one cut expected all of 2026.** Core PCE still at 2.7%. Rate-driven multiple expansion for high-growth tech is off the table near-term. [Source: web_research/QQQ.json macro_context]
- **Tariff overhang.** Apple (~7% QQQ weight) faces lingering tariff pressure on hardware manufactured overseas. The $500B US investment pledge provides political cover but does not eliminate cost risk.

## What would change my mind

**Bearish → Bullish trigger:** Daily SuperTrend flips bullish on the 5-minute chart simultaneously with daily squeeze momentum turning positive AND volume returns to 1.2x+ average — confirming institutional participation not just retail drift.

**Bullish → Bearish trigger:** Daily ADX drops below 25 (trend exhaustion), or a component earnings shock (MSFT/NVDA/AAPL) triggers a gap-down that breaks the $620 weekly support. A second Fed hawkish surprise would reprice the entire growth multiple.
