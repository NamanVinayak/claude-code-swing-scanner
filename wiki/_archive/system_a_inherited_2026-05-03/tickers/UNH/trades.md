# UNH — Trades

## TL;DR

UNH has two records in tracker.db: one cancelled limit order (trade ID 1, placed April 12 at $296 entry) and one abandoned order (trade ID 9, placed April 14 at $305 entry). Neither order was ever filled. Net realized P&L is $0. The system generated a buy signal with 58% confidence and a 3:1 risk-reward on April 11, placed the order, then re-queued it at a higher entry on April 14 before both eventually expired or were cancelled. The underlying thesis — Medicare Advantage rate hike + strong insider buying — was sound, but the market never pulled back to the entry levels the system was waiting for.

## Open positions

**What happened.** The Apr 11 run was the originating analysis. The PM placed a limit-buy at $296, which was the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level below the $304.33 closing price at time of analysis. The reasoning was explicitly "entry on dip to $296 (not chasing at $304)." The order was placed in the early hours of April 12 and cancelled approximately 52 hours later on April 14. The stock did not pull back to $296 in that window — it likely stayed elevated or moved higher in the days following the Medicare Advantage catalyst.

The PM's rationale for the $296 entry (from decisions.json): "Entry on dip to $296 (not chasing at $304). R:R of 3.0:1 ($24 target distance vs $8 stop distance) meets the 2:1 minimum. Risk manager allows $550 max position which fits 1 share at $296. Position size: $296 = 5.9% of portfolio." The notional exposure was tiny: 1 share at $296, the smallest position in the entire portfolio (5.9% of the $5,000 paper account).

**What happened.** Trade 9 was created and abandoned at virtually the same timestamp (2026-04-14 08:45 UTC), indicating the system attempted to re-place the UNH order at a revised entry of $305 — likely reflecting that the stock had moved higher and the original $296 level was no longer reachable — but immediately flagged the order as unable to proceed and marked it abandoned. This could reflect a constraint from the monitor (e.g., a daily open-market check failing to queue the order), an allowed-actions block, or a mismatch between the revised entry price and the available cash limit. No fill occurred.

No trades.

## Prior run decisions (no orders placed)

The Apr 11 swing run (swing_20260411_211655) is the only run that analyzed UNH in the dataset available at bootstrap time. The buy signal from that run originated both trade records above.

| run_id | date | decision | confidence | action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| swing_20260411_211655 | 2026-04-11 | buy | 58% | 1 share at $296 limit, target $320, stop $288 |
| 20260430_194522 | 2026-04-30 | hold | 35% | no trade — RSI 94.3, z-score 2.54, R/R 0.5:1 fails 2:1 minimum; wait for pullback to $348–355 |

## Notes and lessons

**The system was disciplined about entry price — possibly too disciplined.** The PM explicitly refused to chase UNH at $304 when the signal was generated, opting for a limit at $296 (a $8 pullback from the close). If the stock continued higher after the Medicare catalyst without giving back that $8, the order would never fill — which is exactly what appears to have happened. This is the correct behavior (the 3:1 R:R was calculated from the $296 entry; buying at $304 shrinks the target distance without improving the stop, worsening R:R), but it means the system missed the trade.

**The re-queue at $305 is puzzling.** Trade 9's entry price of $305 is above the original close of $304.33, not below it. This suggests the monitor may have attempted to revise the order upward to chase the stock after it moved — and then immediately self-cancelled because the revised R:R math no longer worked. Worth investigating the monitor's re-queue logic if this pattern recurs.

**UNH was the only long in a mostly-short portfolio.** The Apr 11 portfolio had 3 shorts (XOM, CVX, NKE) and just 1 long (UNH) at 5.9% of capital. The small size reflects genuine risk management — UNH's daily volatility was at the 68th percentile, earnings were 8 days away, and the maximum allowed position was $550. At $296/share, only 1 share fit the constraint.

**Next run priority.** If a future run re-analyzes UNH post-April 21 earnings, the key question is whether the thesis held: did earnings confirm recovery or validate the bear case? The gap origin at $281 is the line in the sand — a post-earnings close above it would suggest the thesis survived; a close below it means the Medicare catalyst was absorbed and reversed.
